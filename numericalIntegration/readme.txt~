Compilation instructions: clang++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++

Users of this program must hard code in the function to be integrated straight into the code. 

Only one line of code needs to be changed to incorporate the new function. 

This user can choose three different numerical integration methods: Midpoint Approximation, the Trapezoidal Rule, or Simpson's Rule. 
The user can also specify how many approximations should be made, in addition to where the function should be integrated.
